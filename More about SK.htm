      The flag of South Korea, also known as the Taegukgi, has three parts:
       a white rectangular background, a red and blue Taegeuk in its center,
       and four black trigrams, one in each corner. The flag's field is white, a traditional color in Korean culture.
       The circle in the flag's center symbolizes balance in the universe. The red half represents positive cosmic forces, and the blue half represents the opposing negative cosmic forces.
       Together, the trigrams represent movement and harmony as fundamental principles.

      Changdeok Palace, is set within a large park in Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It is one of the "Five Grand Palaces" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897).
       As it is located east of Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeokgung—along with Changgyeonggung—is also referred to as the "East Palace"
       Changdeokgung was the most favored palace of many Joseon princes and retained many elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period that were not incorporated in
       the more contemporary Gyeongbokgung. One such element is the fact that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it.
       It, like the other Five Grand Palaces in Seoul, was heavily damaged during the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910–1945).
