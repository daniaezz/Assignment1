        The flag of Arab Republic of Egypt is a tricolour consisting of the three equal horizontal
        red, white, and black bands based on the Arab Liberation Flag of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.
        In the centre of the middle band is the Eagle of Saladin, the national symbol of Egypt since 1952,
        and an emblem of Arab nationalism that also serves as the national symbol of Iraq, Palestine, and Yemen,
        and formerly of the United Arab Republic, North Yemen and South Yemen, and the Libyan Arab Republic.
        The red band symbolizes the Egyptiansâ€™ blood in the war against colonization. The white band symbolizes
        the purity of the Egyptian's heart. The black band below the white, symbolizes the manner in which darkness is overcome.

          The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt. Sources cite at least 118 identified Egyptian pyramids.
          Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.
          The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among
          the largest structures ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the
          Ancient World still in existence; this is despite being the oldest wonder by about 2,000 years
